# Dataset:
I used community detection dataset that contains the information of four different communities.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN algorithm.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on community detection. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.Community detection techniques are useful for social media algorithms to discover people with common interests and keep them tightly connected. Community detection can be used in machine learning to detect groups with similar properties and extract groups for various reasons. For example, this technique can be used to discover manipulative groups inside a social network or a stock market.
